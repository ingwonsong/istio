Removing tonumber from JQ call, since it mangles large numbers (#1318)

* Removing tonumber from JQ call, since it mangles large numbers (e.g. timestamps)

* Forgot to run precommit

* Preserving previous behavior for numbers less than json MAXINT

* Fixing formatting

* Switching to regex rather than 'test'.

* Fixing lint failure, adding test

* Adding more tests

* Apparently /bin/yes isn't portable...
