Migrating gateway deployments...
✔ Wrote Gateway to output-path/gateways-istiooperator/istio-ingressgateway.yaml
✔ Wrote Gateway to output-path/gateways-kubernetes/istio-ingressgateway.yaml

Checking configuration compatibility...
✔ No incompatible configuration detected

Actions required to migrate:
- Found 1 gateway deployments. There are two options available to deploy these to ASM managed control plane. Both options will provide the same end result:

(1) Simple Kubernetes Configuration (recommended)

This option contains all of the standard Kubernetes configution, such as Deployment and Services, to deploy a gateway.
If you want to modify the configuration in the future, you can modify these configurations directly.
To deploy these to the cluster, run `kubectl apply -f 'output-path/gateways-kubernetes'` after installing ASM managed control plane.

(2) Continue to use IstioOperator

If you would prefer to continue to use the same IstioOperator API, you may continue to do so.
The 'output-path/gateways-istiooperator' directory contains an IstioOperator per configured gateway. These have been modified to be compatible with ASM managed control plane.
To deploy these to the cluster, run, for each gateway, one of the following commands:
- `istioctl install -f 'output-path/gateways-istiooperator/GATEWAY_NAME.yaml'`
- `istioctl manifest generate -f 'output-path/gateways-istiooperator/GATEWAY_NAME.yaml' | kubectl apply -f -`

TIP: steps recommending `kubectl apply` to be run should be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, if applicable.
